## Report Source Code

This directory contains the complete LaTeX source code and all complementary media required to compile the final report as a PDF file. The compiled report is named `main.pdf` in this directory and has also been copied to the root of the repository as `report.pdf`.

The report is based on the official template for final degree projects provided by the ESEIAAT campus of UPC, and it was written using the TeXstudio editor.

Additionally, the `old_versions` folder contains early drafts and incomplete versions of the report.
