\textit{This project focuses on solving a common problem that many audio engineers and technicians constantly face: system adjustment based on the acoustic environment. Currently, there are some interesting existing solutions, which will be discussed in this project. However, a custom software-based solution will also be developed using Python, with the capability to perform acoustic analysis and correction in real-time. This solution will be presented along with its particularities, strengths, and limitations. The project will include the development of a graphical user interface to provide an easy and intuitive user experience. It will feature Fourier transformation, filter processing, and other implemented algorithms. A microphone, a speaker, and a sound card will be used to allow the program to interact with its environment.}
