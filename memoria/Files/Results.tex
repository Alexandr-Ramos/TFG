About the final program results

There ar not just things to finish or implement, also, it is nedded to solve some actual problems. Most important of them are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Filter Algorithms:}
	
	\item \textbf{User Limitations:} For example, since we are using the Sounddevice library and managing both inputs as a single input stream, we have the limitation that both channels must come from the same sound card. However, the program currently allows the selection of different sound cards for each input channel.
	
\end{itemize}
